SELECT to_tsvector('english', 'Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky.  Sirius is visible on the far leftof the above photograph, to the left of the constellation of Orion and Comet Hale-Bopp. Intrinsically, Sirius is over 20 times brighter than our Sun and over twice as massive. As Sirius is8.7 light years distant, it is not the closest star system - the Alpha Centauri system holds this distinction. Sirius is called the Dog Starbecause of its prominence in the constellation of Canis Majoris (Big Dog). In 1862, Sirius was discovered to be a binarystar system with a companion star, Sirius B, 10,000 times dimmer than thebright primary, Sirius A. Sirius B was the first white dwarf stardiscovered, a type of star first understood by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1930. While studying Sirius in 1718, Edmond Halley discovered that stars movewith respect to each other.  There is conflicting evidence that Sirius appeared more red only 2000 years ago.');

To get an idea, scroll right.  In 1972 during the Apollo 17 mission, astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan found out first hand.  In this case, the world was Earths own Moon.  In one of the more famous panoramas taken on the Moon, the magnificent desolation of the barren Moon is apparent.  Visible are rocks, hills, craters, the lunar rover, and astronaut Schmitt preparing to take a soil sample.  A few days after this image was taken, humanity left the Moon and has yet to return.

SELECT to_tsvector('english', 'What causes black aurora?  These gaps in normal bright aurora are frequently recorded but rarely questioned.  Recent research using data from four Cluster spacecraft orbiting the Earth has now likely found the secret: black auroras are actually anti-auroras.  In normal auroras, electrons and/or predominantly negatively charged particles fall toward Earth along surfaces of constant magnetic field.  They ionize the Earths atmosphere on impact, causing the bright glows.  In black anti-auroras, however, negatively charged particles are sucked out from the Earths ionosphere along adjoining magnetic field lines. These dark anti-auroras can climb to over 20,000 kilometers and last for several minutes.  Pictured above, a black aurora is seen dividing bright auroras over Fairbanks, Alaska, USA.');
